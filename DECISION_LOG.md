# DECISION LOG v1.7, 09/07/2026 (supersedes v1.6; delta = A7: O1/O2/O3 resolved to club-team-count contingency tables; flex slot + minimums semantics; cap computed at lock)
### Locked = operator-approved in spec sessions of 08/07/2026. Open items carry a
### DEFAULT (applies automatically at expiry unless overridden) and an EXPIRY.
### One batched decision sitting per session; no thread proceeds without naming
### which gate or definition-of-done item it moves.

## LOCKED
- D1  Pricing formula: new = (1−α)·old + α·(score × $/pt). α 0.20, $/pt $1,000
      (A5's $500 halving SUPERSEDED by A6 — the operator's final scoring scale
      is ×1 integer, so no pairing adjustment is needed), round nearest $100,
      floor $9,000. Floor and α remain config (see O6/O7).
- D2  DNP = not named in lineup: 0 fantasy points, price frozen, match excluded
      from pricing history.
- D3  Played = named in the lineup of a finalised match. Price adjusts even on 0.
- D4  Starting prices (AMENDED A1, 08/07/2026, supersedes v1.0 phantom-game
      shrinkage): perf = $/pt × last-season per-match average; starting price =
      floor + (min(g,4)/4) × (perf − floor), where g = matches in lineup last
      season (same denominator as the average). g=0 → floor; g≥4 → full perf
      pricing; clamp at floor if perf < floor. Rounding convention (applies to
      ALL price arithmetic incl. D1): nearest $100, half rounds up.
      Hand-adjustable pre-season-lock only.
- D5  Score at match completion; points land in the round containing the final day.
      No day-diffing of two-day matches.
- D6  Rounds are league-manager-defined containers with per-round lock datetimes
      (default Sat 11:00 Adelaide). Hybrid 1/2-week rounds crafted post-fixture.
- D7  Mid-match trade lock, BOTH directions (buy and sell), until match finalised
      and repriced. Rationale: day-1 information exploit is two-sided — buying
      known runs at stale prices and selling known failures pre-drop.
- D8  Cap ledger: cap remaining = starting cap − Σ purchase prices + Σ sale
      proceeds at time-of-sale price. TEAM VALUE (AMENDED A2, 09/07/2026) =
      cap remaining + Σ current prices of holdings (total franchise worth,
      per the operator's worked example frozen as Gate G2 — the gate is
      authoritative); Σ current prices alone is INVESTED VALUE. Both
      display-only; neither touches the cap. Trade-in at current price.
- D9  One role per player per season (BAT/WK/BWL/AR), frozen at season lock;
      WK-ELIGIBLE flag is the only dual eligibility. No DPP.
- D10 Captain ×2; VC inherits on captain DNP; both DNP = no double.
- D11 H2H repeated round-robin; ladder on wins, points-for tiebreak; bye scored
      against round median; separate overall-points leaderboard.
- D12 Scoring rules: single frozen config per season, no mid-season changes, no
      effective-date versioning. SR/economy bonuses gated by min-sample thresholds.
- D13 Economy parameters (team size, composition, cap, scoring values, trades,
      α, floor) live in config tables, tunable pre-lock, frozen by SEASON LOCK.
- D14 Data entry: manual form is v1 core; screenshot→LLM→review→commit is v1
      automation; LLM output never auto-commits. PlayHQ API import = V-NEXT;
      live webhooks out of scope (partner-tier).
- D15 Prime invariant: raw scorecards + config are sole truth; all derived state
      recomputable and never hand-edited (Gate G3).
- D16 Stack: Supabase (Postgres, magic-link auth, storage, RLS) + React/Vite on
      Vercel/Netlify. Manager role enforced in DB.
- D17 Data class INTERNAL (Law 11): auth-walled profiles and photos; club/parental
      consent for photos before upload; no public player pages.
- D18 Bye = round median (subsumed in D11). CLARIFIED A3, 09/07/2026: the median
      is taken over ALL fantasy teams' round scores that round, INCLUDING the
      bye team's own. Byes exist only at odd team counts, so this median is
      always a true integer middle value — no interpolation convention. Known
      consequence, accepted: the bye team wins only from the top half incl.
      itself (e.g. top 2 of 5), slightly harsher than a coin-flip matchup.

## LOCKED — SESSION RULINGS OF 09/07/2026 (A4)
- D19 Washouts/abandonment: 'abandoned' is a match_status. Abandoned matches
      produce no score rows and no price movements (all players DNP, prices
      frozen per D2), and RELEASE the D7 mid-match trade lock (enforcement
      lands in the locks slice). A round is active if it has ≥1 finalised or
      abandoned match; an all-abandoned round is active with all-zero totals →
      all pairings tie, bye ties vs median 0. A round with no entered matches
      does not exist for H2H/ladder/leaderboard purposes.
- D20 Ladder points: win 2 / tie 1 / loss 0 (ladder_points = 2·wins + ties).
      Structural convention, not economy config.
- D21 H2H fixtures are DERIVED, not stored: deterministic round-robin (circle
      method) over the sorted fantasy-team-id set; generateRound is exported so
      the UI renders upcoming fixtures by calling it, never by reading
      h2h_results. BINDING on the G10 slice: season lock freezes fantasy-team
      registration (fixture determinism requires a stable set). Accepted
      trade-off, recorded: no manual matchup adjustment, ever. Home/away labels
      come from circle orientation and never affect results.

## OPEN — DEFAULTS APPLY AT EXPIRY
- O1 Trades per round (A7, 09/07/2026 — resolved to a contingency table, keyed
    on club teams entered, decided when nominations close): 3 club teams →
    2 trades/round; 4 or 5+ club teams → 3 trades/round. Non-banking (default
    stands, flippable pre-lock). EXPIRY: season lock (pick the row).
- O2 Team size & composition (A7 — contingency table; composition semantics
    are now ROLE MINIMUMS + TOTAL SIZE, with FLEX = the unconstrained remainder):
      3 club teams:  size 7  = BAT ≥3, BWL ≥2, AR ≥1, WK ≥1 (no flex)
      4 club teams:  size 9  = BAT ≥3, BWL ≥3, AR ≥1, WK ≥1, 1 flex
      5+ club teams: size 11 = BAT ≥4, BWL ≥4, AR ≥1, WK ≥1, 1 flex
    Strict role counting: a player fills only their own role's minimum (AR is
    never a BAT); flex is the only wildcard slot. WK minimum satisfiable by
    WK-role or wk_eligible players (D9). BUILD NOTE: LeagueConfig.squad
    composition type reshapes from exact counts to minimums+size BEFORE any
    selection-validation layer is built (cheap now, a migration later);
    composition enforcement currently has NO gate — named scope for the
    app/validation slice. EXPIRY: season lock (pick the row).
- O3 Salary cap (A7): cap = team_size × MEAN STARTING PRICE across ALL players
    in the pool at season lock (i.e. 1.0×, no headroom — stars funded by
    basement filler; gun-concentration accepted as a knowing choice), computed
    BY the season-lock action itself (starting prices materialise at lock per
    Rider 3, so the mean is well-defined at that moment), rounded to nearest
    $100. Illustration on 25/26 data: mean $32,000 → 11-size cap ≈ $352k;
    basement newcomers pull the mean (and cap) down by design.
    EXPIRY: season lock (computed).
- O4 Scoring values. OPERATOR-CHOSEN DRAFT (A6, 09/07/2026, supersedes the ×2
    scale): run 1, 50 bonus 10, 100 bonus 20, duck −5, not-out 5, four 1,
    six 3, wicket 19, maiden 1, 5WI 10, economy bonus = floor(max(0, 0.25 ×
    (balls bowled − runs conceded))) applied PER MATCH (fractional remainder
    discarded each game; no min-overs threshold; no penalty above 6/over),
    outfield catch 10, runout 15 (both kinds), WK catch 10, stumping 15. NO
    strike-rate bonuses. All per-event values integer; econ floor keeps match
    scores whole. Calibrated on 25/26 data: BAT 45.2% / BOWL 43.1% / FIELD
    11.7%. Still open until season lock. EXPIRY: season lock.
- O5 SR/economy thresholds — SUPERSEDED by O4 draft (09/07/2026): SR bonuses
    dropped; economy handled as the continuous per-run bonus inside O4. The
    threshold-style bonus fields remain in the scoring schema (config-driven,
    set to zero) for the fixture config and any future revival.
- O6 Price floor. LOCKED at $9,000 for now; flagged revisitable pre-lock.
- O7 α. LOCKED at 0.20 for now; flagged revisitable pre-lock.
- O8 Hybrid round map. Cannot decide until fixture release. DEFAULT if fixtures
    misbehave: pure weekly rounds + rely on D7 mid-match lock. EXPIRY: 1 week
    after fixture release.
